This layer contains abstractions, which will be defined in implementation layer
I chose this structure in order to gain familiarity with Project organization because of the Final Exam

Here are defined:
1. UseCases
2. Logging
3. Exceptions
4. Mailers

Important note!
Compared to other design pattern eg. Repository, Mediator etc...
We will not include any concrete logic in here
This layer will not be dependent on any library/technology/implementatio
Some people will try to add Jwt logic in here, but that is a bad practice, because we will limit our application to that specific implementation
