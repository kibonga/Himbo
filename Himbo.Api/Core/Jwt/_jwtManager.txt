Important thing about JwtManager!

Login and Register are two separate things

1. Register is defined in Application layer and implemented in Implementation layer
eg. EfRegisterUserCommand: IRegisterUserCommand
- After successfull registration nothing is being returned (void) and User has to Login afterwards
- This is done in order to separate Login/Register functionalities because Login is dependant on Jwt logic and Register is not

3. Login is defined in Api layer, 
- This is done in order to separate Login/Register functionalities because Login is dependant on Jwt logic and Register is not
- Login (defined in Api layer) uses Jwt logic, and that is only relevant to Api
- We deliberately don't want Jwt to be inside Application/Implementation layer
- One could argue that the Login could be defined in Implementation layer
