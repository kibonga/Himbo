- Container Extensions is a static class used for separating Services
- We could have used similar option by defining  static {ProjectName}ServicesRegistration class with static IServiceCollection method
eg. 
public static class {ProjectName}ServicesRegistration
{
    public static IServiceCollection Configure{ProjectName}Services(this IServiceCollection services, IConfiguration configuration)
    {
        services.AddDbContext<DbContext>(options =>
            options.UseSqlServer(
                configuration.GetConnectionString("LeaveManagementConnectionString")));

        return services;
    }
}
- But for the code familiarity sake and Exam, we will use first option 
- Jwt is specific to Api, that is why its not defined on lower level


What is defined in Container extensions
1. AddUseCases - Register all use cases used inside application
2. AddHimboDbContext - Register DbContext which will be used through application
3. AddJwt - Registers JwtManager and adds additional (jwt) options to Authentication service
4. AddApplicationUser - Register User (IApplicationUser), if User is signed in use JwtUser if he is not use AnonymousUser
